\section intro Introduction

Tracter is a data flow framework.  It was written initially for doing
speech signal processing in the context of <a
href="http://www.idiap.ch/software/juicer">Juicer</a>.  It has
developed into more of a wrapper for other packages.

Tracter-GPL is a supplementary package of components that link with
Gnu General Public Licensed packages.  The GPL stipulates that these
components must themselves be GPL.  The core of tracter is BSD, hence
the separate package.

\section use Usage

The general idea is that you can link against tracter-gpl instead of
tracter to get the functionality of tracter with added GPL value.  At
the time of writing, the two modules in tracter-gpl duplicate
functionality of BSD versions in tracter.  Linking with tracter-gpl
should yield the GPL ones in the resulting executable, even if the BSD
ones are in tracter.

\section download Obtaining the source code

Tracter-GPL is available <a
href="http://www.idiap.ch/software/tracter-gpl/sources">here</a>.  By
it's nature as a supplementary library, tracter-gpl is simply wrappers
for external dependencies:
 - The core <a href="http://www.idiap.ch/software/tracter">tracter</a>
library provides data-flow functionality and connectivity.
 - <a href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW</a> is a high performance FFT
library.
 - <a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/">samplerate</a>, or SRC, is
a resampling library.  It claims to be quite fast and quite accurate.
