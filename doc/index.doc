/**
\mainpage Tracter GPL

\section intro Introduction

Tracter is a modular real time signal processing system.  It defines a
framework for a directed graph of plugins that each do (typically)
small amounts of computation.

Tracter GPL is a supplementary package of components that link with
Gnu General Public Licensed packages.  The GPL stipulates that these
components must themselves be GPL.  The core of tracter is BSD, hence
the separate package.
