As of March 2010, the build system is based on CMake.  To build, you
should only need to do the following:

 cd build
 cp Configure.sh.example Configure.sh
 (edit Configure.sh to suit your environment)
 ./Configure.sh
 make
 make install


Below are instructions for the old Gnu build system.  This should be
removed in a future version.

If you got tracter-gpl as a tarball then it includes a standard gnu
build environment.  Just follow the instructions in INSTALL, although
you might wish to use a VPATH build described below.

If you got tracter-gpl from git, you need autoconf, automake and
libtool.  The following commands are necessary to boot up the gnu
build environment:

 autoheader
 aclocal
 libtoolize
 autoconf
 automake -a

Then, assuming you want to use this as a working repository, I suggest
you use a VPATH style build.  This builds in a separate tree allowing
several parallel builds that don't mess up the source directory:

 mkdir build
 cd build
 ../configure CXXFLAGS='-Wall -Werror -Os -g'
 make

The executables will appear in build/src

Documentation is provided in doxygen form.  Go to the build directory
(the directory containing Doxyfile) and type

 doxygen

You can then point a browser at html/index.html
